### Day 5

#### All day
On the last day, you hopefully have the tools to get started with work on your own datasets. We are available for all questions and support. Alternatively, or if you do not have your own project data yet, you are welcome to choose one of the challenges below (or come up with your own!).

- Option 1: [Doublet detection](https://buchauer-lab.github.io/charite-sc-data-course/doubletexercise/)
- Option 2: Differentiation pseudotime
- Option 3: Try playing with a CITE-Seq dataset
