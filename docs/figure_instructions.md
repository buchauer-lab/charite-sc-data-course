### Prepare a figure representing the data set

Finally, using all you learned in the last days, prepare a figure consisting of four panels to represent the data set and the analysis you conducted (imagine you want to present the data set on a conference poster).
Add a figure legend/caption explaining each panel in sufficient detail.

**python users**: please assemble the figure in a graphics programm of your choice. The final figure should be in .pdf or .png format.

**R users**: You can either assemble your figure entirely in R using the ggarrange package (see here: https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggarrange.html) or export your plot panels using the
ggsave function and arrange them in a graphics programm of your choice. The final figure should be in .pdf or .png format.
