### Welcome!

#### __Single-Cell Data Analysis Course for Beginners @Charité__

_for Charité MD / MD/PhD / PhD students, postdocs and interested scientific staff_

**Dates:** 22.09.2025 - 26.09.2025 from 9:30 am to 4 pm, on-site (partially CCM, partially CVK). __This course is fully booked.__

**Description:**  
This one-week on-site course is intended for pre- and postdoctoral researchers as well as scientific staff members interested in getting started with single-cell RNA-Seq data analysis. The course specifically welcomes participants without any prior programming experience and includes introductory elements to python or R as well as dedicated time to set up the required environments on participants' laptops. During the course, we will cover the following topics:  

- basic introduction to python or R
- raw sequencing data processing (from FASTQ to count matrix)
- understanding single cell data formats
- quality control
- data normalization, feature selection and dimension reduction
- clustering and visualisation
- cell type annotation
- differential abundance and differential gene expression calculations
- basics of data integration and batch correction

Participants will be provided with practice data sets and time will be allocated to hands-on analysis of these data sets. There is also an option to work on own data towards the end of the course (if available; own data is not a participation requirement). Participants need to be available on all course days and bring a laptop on which you have user permissions to install software (specifically, this might not be the case for some centrally administrated Charité devices). The course will be held in English.

#### Use of the materials on this website
All materials used to teach the course as well as the workshop materials and datasets are available via this website and the corresponding github repository. They are structured by day of the course, so if you want to start at the beginning, move right to [Day 1](https://buchauer-lab.github.io/charite-sc-data-course/Day1). You are invited to use these materials for self-study. Feedback is welcome.
