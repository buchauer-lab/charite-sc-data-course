This is a subset from the 10x Genomics v3 10k PBMC dataset ("10k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor (v3 chemistry)"; https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/10-k-pbm-cs-from-a-healthy-donor-v-3-chemistry-3-standard-3-0-0).
Cell numbers were reduced while keeping the individual cells' sequencing depth the same. Only some cell types from the whole dataset were kept. A number of empty droplets and low-quality cells are included.
